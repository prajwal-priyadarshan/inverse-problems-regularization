# LLM Pseudoinverse Reconstruction

A compact toolkit to demonstrate instability of naive pseudoinverse solutions for ill-posed 1D linear inverse problems and to compare classical regularization methods (Tikhonov, TSVD). LLM-guided decision-making is supported optionally via OpenAI API.

## Components
- `data/` synthetic signals, operators, and noisy measurements (placeholders; generated by scripts/notebooks).
- `src/` reusable modules for signal generation, forward operators, noise models, reconstruction methods, diagnostics, evaluation, and utilities.
- `experiments/` notebooks for baseline failure, regularization comparison, LLM-guided selection, and noise sensitivity.
- `results/` figures, metrics, and LLM outputs (once generated).
- `docs/` methodology and experiment notes.

## Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment and install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the pipeline (saves data, figures, metrics): `python run_pipeline.py --noise-level all`.
	- Add `--enable-llm` if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to generate LLM recommendations.
3. Open `experiments/exp_01_baseline_failure.ipynb` to reproduce the baseline failure and diagnostics.

## Notes
- Scope is currently 1D signals only.
- Forward operator defaults to a Gaussian blur to induce ill-posedness.
- Set `GROQ_API_KEY` to enable the optional LLM step; otherwise stub outputs are written.
