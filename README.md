# LLM-Guided Regularization of Pseudoinverse for Ill-Posed Signal Reconstruction

## 📌 Project Motivation

Inverse problems occur across signal processing, imaging, and scientific computing, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal `x` from observed data `y` governed by a linear model:

y = A x + noise

In many real-world cases, the operator `A` is **ill-conditioned or rank-deficient**, making the inverse problem **ill-posed**. Direct inversion using the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse leads to **severe noise amplification** and unstable reconstructions.

Classical regularization techniques such as **Tikhonov regularization** and **Truncated SVD (TSVD)** stabilize the inversion, but they require **manual parameter tuning** and expert knowledge.

### 🎯 Core Idea of This Project

This project introduces an **LLM-in-the-loop framework** where:

- All numerical computations remain **classical and exact**
- An **LLM acts only as a decision-making agent**
- The LLM analyzes **spectral diagnostics** and **error trends**
- The LLM selects the most suitable regularization method and parameter
- The system remains **theoretically grounded, interpretable, and extensible**

## 🧠 Strong Points of This Project

- Heavy mathematical foundation (linear algebra & inverse problems)
- No black-box deep learning for reconstruction
- LLM is used **only for reasoning**, not computation
- Dataset-backed validation (BSDS300 test images)
- Fully modular and LLM-agnostic (OpenAI / Gemini / Groq)
- Clear separation of **physics**, **math**, and **AI reasoning**
